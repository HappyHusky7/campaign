# campaign

Things to add;
Rewrite paragraph text to be relevant.
Create class to italicise the word 'Campaign'. Class already set up for most places.
Add newsletter section to index page and auditions page.

Potential fixes to make;
Footer not on bottom of page when low amount of content on page.
Reposition video on index?
Remove gallery page?
CSS in JS file, can't seem to move without breaking things.

Fixes I can't solve;
Fix Border on Auditions Page - alignment issue. Not an issue on mobile.
Showtime container on tickets page movement affected by seat-map. Not an issue on mobile.
