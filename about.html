            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>In the high-stakes arena of a presidential election, two brilliant strategists find themselves on opposite sides. One is a seasoned idealist, the other a ruthless pragmatist. As they battle for the hearts and minds of the nation, their professional rivalry ignites a passionate, secret affair that could derail both of their careers and the fate of the country. <em>Campaign</em> explores the cost of ambition, the nature of truth, and whether love can survive in a world where winning is everything.</p>
